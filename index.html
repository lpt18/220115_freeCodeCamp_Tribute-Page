                    <p>Ph.D. University of Budapest, Hungary, 1926</p>
                    <p>John von Neumann is perhaps best known known for his work in the early development of computers: As director of the Electronic Computer Project at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study (1945-1955), he developed MANIAC (mathematical analyzer, numerical integrator and computer), which was at the time the fastest computer of its kind. He also made important contributions in the fields of mathematical logic, the foundations of quantum mechanics, economics and game theory. </p>
                    <p>He was born in Budapest and received his undergraduate degree in chemical engineering there before coming to the U.S. His principal academic appointment was as professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, from 1933 until his death in 1957, and he also worked on the Manhattan project to develop atomic weapons. He began the study of game theory and co-wrote the classic text Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour with Oskar Morgenstern. In 1938, von Neumann was awarded the AMS Bôcher Memorial Prize. He was one of the most outstanding and best known mathematicians to serve as AMS president, and was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.</p>

                            <p>Von Neumann's birthplace, at 16 Báthory Street, Budapest. Since 1968, it has housed the John von Neumann Computer Society.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Von Neumann was born on December 28, 1903 to a wealthy, acculturated and non-observant Jewish family. His Hungarian birth name was Neumann János Lajos. In Hungarian, the family name comes first, and his given names are equivalent to John Louis in English.</p>
                        <p>Von Neumann was born in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the eldest of three brothers; his two younger siblings were Mihály (English: Michael von Neumann; 1907–1989) and Miklós (Nicholas von Neumann, 1911–2011). His father, Neumann Miksa (Max von Neumann, 1873–1928) was a banker, who held a doctorate in law. He had moved to Budapest from Pécs at the end of the 1880s. Miksa's father and grandfather were both born in Ond (now part of the town of Szerencs), Zemplén County, northern Hungary. John's mother was Kann Margit (English: Margaret Kann); her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels of the Meisels family. Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest; von Neumann's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor.</p>
                        <p>On February 20, 1913, Emperor Franz Joseph elevated John's father to the Hungarian nobility for his service to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation Margittai, meaning "of Margitta" (today Marghita, Romania). The family had no connection with the town; the appellation was chosen in reference to Margaret, as was their chosen coat of arms depicting three marguerites. Neumann János became margittai Neumann János (John Neumann de Margitta), which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann.</p>

                            <p>Excerpt from the university calendars for 1928 and 1928/29 of the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin announcing Neumann's lectures on axiomatic set theory and mathematical logic, new work in quantum mechanics and special functions of mathematical physics.                   </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Von Neumann's habilitation was completed on December 13, 1927, and he began to give lectures as a Privatdozent at the University of Berlin in 1928.[37] He was the youngest person ever elected Privatdozent in the university's history in any subject.[38] By the end of 1927, von Neumann had published 12 major papers in mathematics, and by the end of 1929, 32, a rate of nearly one major paper per month.[39] His powers of recall allowed him to quickly memorize the pages of telephone directories, and recite the names, addresses and numbers therein.[20] In 1929, he briefly became a Privatdozent at the University of Hamburg, where the prospects of becoming a tenured professor were better,[40] but in October of that year a better offer presented itself when he was invited to Princeton University.[41]</p>
                        <p>On New Year's Day in 1930, von Neumann married Marietta Kövesi, who had studied economics at Budapest University.[41] Von Neumann and Marietta had one child, a daughter, Marina, born in 1935. As of 2021 Marina is a distinguished professor emerita of business administration and public policy at the University of Michigan.[42] The couple divorced in 1937. In October 1938, von Neumann married Klara Dan, whom he had met during his last trips back to Budapest before the outbreak of World War II.[43]</p>
                        <p>In 1930, before marrying Marietta, von Neumann was baptized into the Catholic Church.[44] Von Neumann's father, Max, had died in 1929. None of the family had converted to Christianity while Max was alive, but all did afterward.[45]</p>
                        <p>In 1933, he was offered a lifetime professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study in New Jersey when that institution's plan to appoint Hermann Weyl fell through.[46] He remained a mathematics professor there until his death, although he had announced his intention to resign and become a professor at large at the University of California, Los Angeles.[47] His mother, brothers and in-laws followed von Neumann to the United States in 1939.[48] Von Neumann anglicized his first name to John, keeping the German-aristocratic surname von Neumann. His brothers changed theirs to "Neumann" and "Vonneumann".[14] Von Neumann became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1937, and immediately tried to become a lieutenant in the United States Army's Officers Reserve Corps. He passed the exams easily but was rejected because of his age.[49] His prewar analysis of how France would stand up to Germany is often quoted: "Oh, France won't matter."[50]</p>
                        <p>Klara and John von Neumann were socially active within the local academic community.[51] His white clapboard house at 26 Westcott Road was one of Princeton's largest private residences.[52] He always wore formal suits. He once wore a three-piece pinstripe while riding down the Grand Canyon astride a mule.[53] Hilbert is reported to have asked, "Pray, who is the candidate's tailor?" at von Neumann's 1926 doctoral exam, as he had never seen such beautiful evening clothes.[54]</p>
                        <p>Von Neumann held a lifelong passion for ancient history and was renowned for his historical knowledge. A professor of Byzantine history at Princeton once said that von Neumann had greater expertise in Byzantine history than he did.[55]</p>
                        <p>Von Neumann liked to eat and drink; his wife, Klara, said that he could count everything except calories. He enjoyed Yiddish and "off-color" humor (especially limericks).[19] He was a non-smoker.[56] In Princeton, he received complaints for regularly playing extremely loud German march music on his phonograph, which distracted those in neighboring offices, including Albert Einstein, from their work.[57] Von Neumann did some of his best work in noisy, chaotic environments, and once admonished his wife for preparing a quiet study for him to work in. He never used it, preferring the couple's living room with its television playing loudly.[58] Despite being a notoriously bad driver, he enjoyed driving—frequently while reading a book—occasioning numerous arrests as well as accidents. When Cuthbert Hurd hired him as a consultant to IBM, Hurd often quietly paid the fines for his traffic tickets.[59]</p>
                    <p>Von Neumann's closest friend in the United States was mathematician Stanislaw Ulam. A later friend of Ulam's, Gian-Carlo Rota, wrote, "They would spend hours on end gossiping and giggling, swapping Jewish jokes, and drifting in and out of mathematical talk." When von Neumann was dying in the hospital, every time Ulam visited, he came prepared with a new collection of jokes to cheer him up.[60] Von Neumann believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively; he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved and know the answer upon waking up.[58] Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more aural.[61]</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The von Neumann architecture — also known as the von Neumann model or Princeton architecture — is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John von Neumann and others in the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC.[1] That document describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with these components:</p>
                        <ul class="list-content">
                            <li>A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers</li>
                            <li>A control unit that contains an instruction register and program counter</li>
                            <li>Memory that stores data and instructions</li>
                            <li>External mass storage</li>
                            <li>Input and output mechanisms</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The term "von Neumann architecture" has evolved to mean any stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus. This is referred to as the von Neumann bottleneck, and often limits the performance of the system.</p>
                        <p>The design of a von Neumann architecture machine is simpler than a Harvard architecture machine—which is also a stored-program system but has one dedicated set of address and data buses for reading and writing to memory, and another set of address and data buses to fetch instructions.</p>
                        <p>A stored-program digital computer keeps both program instructions and data in read–write, random-access memory (RAM). Stored-program computers were an advancement over the program-controlled computers of the 1940s, such as the Colossus and the ENIAC. Those were programmed by setting switches and inserting patch cables to route data and control signals between various functional units. The vast majority of modern computers use the same memory for both data and program instructions, but have caches between the CPU and memory, and, for the caches closest to the CPU, have separate caches for instructions and data, so that most instruction and data fetches use separate buses (split cache architecture).</p>
